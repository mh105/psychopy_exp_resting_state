# Resting state task

## Description
This is a resting state used to measure occipital alpha activity in human subjects. The task begins with a 3-min eyes-closed period, during which occipital alpha rhythm is expected to be strong and robust. Then the subject is instructed to look at a fixation cross at the center of the screen for another 3-min period, during which the occipital alpha activity is expected to attenuate in strength.

## Outcome measures
- Occipital alpha strength (mean spectral power / magnitude)
- Individual alpha frequency
- Alpha reactivity to visual inputs (eyes-closed minus eyes-open)
- Alpha stability quantified with switching state-space modeling
